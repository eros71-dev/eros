# Welcome to City 17.

Hi, I'm eros71, also known as eros744, I usually work on HTML, CSS, and Java related stuff (mostly not on github in the case of Java).
I've worked on the sm64js site, and I'm learning some Java and SQL basics. I also make some other Mario-related stuff as well.

I usually work on Mario related projects, but also some web stuff. Even though I know a little Java, I really don't like it at all.
