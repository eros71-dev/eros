# Welcome to City 17.

Hi, I'm eros71, also known as eros744, I'm a beginner game developer.
I also know some Java, PHP, SQL (and the HTML, CSS, JS, the usual web app things).
I also make some other Mario-related stuff, and original music as well.

Contributed along with the other two devs in Xeno Butchers. (https://xenobutchers.itch.io/xeno-butchers)
